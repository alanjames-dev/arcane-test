Light Yagami (Tatsuya Fujiwara) is a normal,	 	     	     	    
undistinguished college student -- that is,     	   	  	      
until he discovers an odd notebook lying on       		  	      
the ground. He soon discovers that the notebook     	       	   	      
has magic powers: If someone's name is written     	  	       	   
on it while the writer imagines that person's	      	     	     	    
face, he or she will die. Intoxicated with his    	     	    	       
new godlike power, Light kills those he deems   	       	  	       
unworthy of life. But a mysterious detective    	    	   
known only as L (Ken'ichi Matsuyama) becomes	       	      	      	       
determined to put a stop to his reign.
