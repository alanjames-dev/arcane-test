    <p id="para1">It was pretty neat, Darlene thought to herself. She had to go around the whole boat about 3 to 4 times to figure it out. She found the room in her 5th round.
As she was staring at the room, her heart skipped a beat, is this the end of the game? Does this room hold all the answers like Mr A mentioned? Or would the 
whole travel to the Gulf of Farallones, which aparently is very very far, become a waste? Not to mention the number of times she got sea sick..
She slowly opened the room, holding her breath. It was just like the name suggested- a stinky den. She took a swift glance through the room and made sure there was no one inside.
The room nauseated her. It was very stinky, not to mention her fear of any creepy crawlies lurking around.
She took a deep breath, tied her hair into a ponytail, ready to find whatever it was that she had to find. 
Damn, the stench, whispered Darlene../
She kept searching for what seemed like hours. When she was sure that only the garbage contents were left, she sat down, hands on her face. After a few mins, composing herself
she got up, ready to find the answers. As she tried getting up, she tripped over a plastic bag, and fell face flat to the ground.
She hit her right arm in the corner of the room, but she saw somehting, that made her completely forget about the pain in her hand.
There was a very tiny vent in the right corner of the room. It was very well hidden.
Using her unharmed hand, she opened up the vent.../
As she looked inside, she saw a small red USB. Grabbing it, she ran to her laptop, stumbling once.
All she could hope was that it was a legit clue which would lead her somewhere. After what felt like an hour, the USB was all set to reveal itself.
Oops...it was encrypted. Ugh! I should have seen that coming, whispered Darlene to no one in particular.
It was quite a task, but Darlene had a lot of time to spare in the boat on the way back home, and just before the sun was down she decrypted it.
The USB had 2 contents, an audio file and what seemed like a zip file.//
