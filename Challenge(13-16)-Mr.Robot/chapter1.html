    <p id="para1">Darlene kept staring at her laptop, waiting for something to pop up in her inbox. This had now become a part of her routine since the last 2 weeks. Waiting was the only part that she hated about her “other job”, but this time even her partner didn’t have anything to say, which was weird. After one more glance at her inbox, she switched off her laptop and went to bed./
It was a sunny morning, and Darlene had already reached her office and started her usual work. Her inbox was open in one tab and as she worked, she kept glancing at it, waiting for a mail from Mr X./
She worked as a receptionist during the day, but what made Darlene a person of interest was the fact that she was also a freelance hacker. Darlene and her partner Mr X had been working together for the past 2 years. Mr X would bring them clients, and they split their work equally. She was quite proud of the work they did. The best part of it was her rapport with Mr. X which made everything fun. Darlene often wondered what type of a person her partner was in the real world- what his name was, what he looked like… However, since the last 2 weeks Mr X had not contacted her, nor did she get any clients, but more than the work aspect, she was actually worried about him./
‘DING’- At last a mail from Mr X. She frantically opened up the mail, but all it said was- SOS and attached was the following picture..../ He is in trouble and it is upto Darlene to help her partner.// # //</p>
