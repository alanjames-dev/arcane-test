    <p style="text-align: left;margin: 0;font-size: 10pt;width: 50%;display: none;color: #ffffff;">Darlene was delighted to have found the mystery person- Mr A he called himself. It was quite an easy task, she thought. She had to find a way to contact him next. Hackers, or even informants were hard to find in the dark web. Looking at the laptop screen Darlene couldn't help but grin, she was not just nervous but also very excited. She loved a hard task!/ 
        Rubbing her hands together, she started her work- the work she was always secretly best at..../ Mr A, lets see what secrets you hold, whispered Darlene..../ It hardly took Darlene an hour, she not only found out Mr A's phone number, but also his address and a bit information about his personality. Seems like, he isn't that good at keeping stuff private.</p>/</b><br><br><br>
