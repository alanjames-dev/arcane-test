    <p id="para1">Wow! A personal letter from Mr X, Darlene was ecstatic, it meant that she was on the right path./
                She slapped herself and reread the message once again. Yes! It did say Mr X wanted her help! Darlenes help! Wow, she whispered. Mr X had lots of contacts in the hacker world, but he reached out to her. Wow!! /
                When the excitement washed down, it got replaced with questions.../
                Why? What could have happened to her partner? He even said he couldn't crack the password and to disguise as Edward.../
                Who the hell is Edward?/
                A password Mr X cannot crack? Who the hell is behind this? /
                After about 10 mins, Darlene jolted back to reality, she completely forgot that Mr X was still missing, and that her chase was not yet over.../
                She opened up the USB contents once again, and opened the second file it contained, wishing this was the last play.//
                "DEAR DARLENE, I HOPE YOU NEVER GET THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE IF YOU DO, IT MEANS I AM IN TROUBLE. THERE IS ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW, I DID NOT WANT TO INVOLVE YOU IN ANY OF THIS BUT I HAD NO OTHER OPTION - I NEED YOUR HELP. YOU HAVE TO HACK INTO A SERVER! THE IP ADDRESS IS "65.2.33.212"/DISGUISE YOURSELF AS EDWARD AND LOGIN.  I DIDN'T HAVE  ENOUGH TIME TO CRACK THE PASSWORD. YOU CAN FIND THE INFORMATION I FOUND OUT AT THE END OF THIS MESSAGE. IT IS GOING TO BE A BIT OF A TASK, BUT I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT. SO, PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP. IT HAS TO BE YOU! FIND ME! -MR X/
                
                The Password can be found in "rockyou.txt"./</p>
